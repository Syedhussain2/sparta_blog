##Challenges
One of the challenges i faced  was to figure out how everything was connected. It was initially difficult to go back and make changes to the code and follow the errors to solve the problems. I think with practice this will improve, which i feel it already has with this homeowork.

## Takeaways

I feel a lot more comfortable with rails in comparison to the beginning of the week. I need to keep on pushing myself and give the bonus tasks a chance.
